          <h2 id="front-h2">Iceland is one of the world’s most incredible destinations, largely due to it’s jaw-dropping
            natural landscape. It has everything from lava fields to glaciers. It’s a dream destination if you love the
            great outdoors and exploring
            everything that nature has to offer. However, planning a tour of Iceland and organizing the logistics by
            yourself can quickly turn into a nightmare, as you’ll have loads of questions about how to get the best out
            of your vacation.

            <p class="small-padding">Some of your questions might include: How can you possibly decide what’s worth
              seeing when there are so
              many things to choose from like volcanos, geysers, waterfalls, hot water springs, basalt columns, huge
              crevices, glaciers, lagunes, and mud pools, and when several months wouldn’t be enough to see it all?

            <ul class="large-padding">
              <li>Once you do have a rough itinerary, how can it be arranged so that it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg?
              </li>
              <li>Where should you book your stay and what should you eat in a country where a bed in a hostel can cost
                100 euros a night?</li>
              <li>What is the best time of year to go so the inclement weather doesn’t ruin your plans?</li>
              <li>Is it better to go in winter when it’s cold and dark, or in summer when it’s light for 20 hours each
                day?</li>

            <h2 class="small-padding">BTS Has <br> the Answers</h2>
            <p class="large-padding">
              Beyond the Standard’s answers to these tricky questions is two campervan tours of Iceland; one in the
              winter, one in summer. Each tour is organized by local Icelandic tour guides who jam pack the tour with
              both the absolute must-see sights and hidden gems.
            </p>

            <p class="small-padding">
              The campervan is a transformed mini bus with heating, a table, chairs, a basic
              kitchen, a bed and bedding. By going with a campervan, you’ll get the spontaneity and adventure of
              backpacking, while also
              enjoying the comfort of a hotel stay. There’s always a place you can escape to when you need a moment, and
              you’ll have a warm bed to sleep in at the end of a long and exciting day.
            </p>

            <p class="large-padding">
              It’s important to be flexible when touring Iceland. Your tour guides will keep an eye on the weather
              forecasts, and things can always be adapted if rain clouds make the existing plan tricky. In a country
              where it rains almost every day, the best kind of tour is one that can escape the clouds at a moment's
              notice. By keeping an eye on the weather and trying to steer clear of clouds, we have the best chance of
              seeing the northern lights during the winter tour.
            </p>

            <p class="small-padding">In Iceland, forward thinking and planning is super important, when it comes to keeping the reins on our
              budget too. One of the ways we keep the cost of our tour affordable, is by shopping for local ingredients
              together and cooking meals on our campervan’s grill.
            </p>

            <p>Surprisingly, there are some things in Iceland, which are actually cheaper than in other parts of the
              world. These include world-class lamb hearts, cod, crustaceans, lamb, and beef. Forget that old stereotype
              of fermented shark meat!

            <h3>D1 — <span>Arrival, hot river, and lava tunnel </span>(100 km)</h3>
            <p class="small-padding">Arriving at Keflavík airport, we’ll pick up our campervans. Then we’ll travel to the island’s south
              western corner to Hveragerði. Here we’ll check out the bubbling hot springs, and enjoy an excursion to
              the
              boiling lake where you can also bathe if you wish. Nearby, we’ll visit a lava tunnel, which is several
              thousands of years old. If you’re brave enough you can even climb inside.
            </p>
            <h3>D2 — <span>Geysers, waterfalls, and natural baths </span>(230 km)</h3>
            <p class="large-padding">Iceland’s most famous sight has got to be Geysir, after which geysers got their name. Gullfoss is the
              most famous of Iceland’s waterfalls, and after visiting it, we’ll explore another waterfall called
              Skógafoss from above, underneath, outside, and inside. We’ll actually spend tonight at the foot of this
              waterfall. For those who still have energy to burn, we’ll visit the outdoor swimming pool at
              Seljavallalaug, which is half natural and half man-made.</p>
            <h3>D3 — <span>Basalt columns, canyon, glacier </span>(180 km)</h3>
            <p class="small-padding">First up, we’ll visit the beautiful black basalt columns at Reynisfjara, which is situated on an
              impressive black sandy beach. Then, we’ll visit a stunning canyon before spending the night at
              Skaftafell
              at the foot of the Vatnajökull glacier.</p>
            <h3>D4 — <span>Icebergs, seals, and Scandinavian townships </span>(140 km)</h3>
            <p class="small-padding">In the morning we’ll climb up a hill and look out to see how icebergs and ice walls separate from the
              glacier and float out into the ocean. In what promises to be a magical moment, seals will play all
              around
              us. We’ll spend the evening in a small town called Höfn, where they serve the best lobster in all of
              Iceland. There’s also a great pool in Höfn where we can soak in the warm water or zip down water slides.
            </p>
            <h3>D5 — <span>Fishing village, fjords, northern lights </span>(420 km)</h3>
            <p class="large-padding">We’ll drive a lot, but the upside is that we’ll travel along the most beautiful scenic route available.
              We’ll pass fewer and fewer cars as we head to the north-west of the island. We’ll stop by a fishing
              village on the banks of a fjord, which would actually be the perfect set for a Wes Anderson film. We’ll
              spend the night right up north, on the banks of the Myvatn lake. If we’re lucky and it’s a clear night,
              we’ll be able to see the northern lights, too.</p>
            <h3>D6 — <span>Bright blue thermal waters, a geothermal display, lava fields, and the north’s capital Akureyri
              </span>(120 km)</h3>
            <p class="large-padding">Before we go swimming in what could be one of Iceland’s most beautifully bright blue thermal baths,
              we’ll
              visit an incredibly active geothermal display, full of bubbling mud pots and steam rising from the
              earth.
              Here at Hverirt we’ll also visit a lava field and the world's largest geothermal power plant. We’ll
              spend
              the night in Akureyri, which is Iceland's second biggest city. Tonight we’ll sleep not in our campervan
              but in a capsule hotel, which you might recognize if you’re into Japanese sci-fi.</p>
